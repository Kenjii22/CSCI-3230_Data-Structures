I found this chapter to be very difficult. Because of this, I was not able to finish these projects at all. The code presented here is not my own, but instead the code presented as the correct code by Revel. I include it, here not to claim it as my own, but to have it accessible to myself for the future as a place to help me understand how to code these methods correctly in the future.
